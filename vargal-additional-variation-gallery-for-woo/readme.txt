== Description ==

Additional variation gallery for WooCommerce is a feature that allows store owners to display a custom set of images for each product variation—such as different colors, sizes, or styles. Instead of showing just one image per variation, it creates a full image gallery tailored to each option a customer selects.

This kind of plugin is essential for stores where visuals play a key role – fashion, beauty, furniture, electronics, and more.

###FEATURES

&#9658; **Dedicated Additional Variation Gallery**:Highlight every variation with its own gallery. VARGAL allows you to go beyond WooCommerce’s single gallery system. With VARGAL, every variation of a product can have its own collection of media, including

- Add multiple items at once – Save your time!

- Images and Videos: Upload both image and video files to your variation gallery. Give shoppers a full view of what each variation looks like in action.

- Drag & Drop Sorting: Reorder gallery items easily by dragging and dropping them inside the upload interface—no coding or complex settings.

- Use Product Image & Default Gallery: Optionally include the main product image and the default WooCommerce gallery in the variation gallery for a fuller visual presentation.

This is ideal for stores selling fashion, accessories, furniture, gadgets, or any product where visuals make the difference.

&#9658; **Interactive Additional Variation Gallery Display**: Create a more engaging and intuitive experience. VARGAL makes it easy for customers to interact with your product images and videos. You control how the gallery behaves and feels

- Zoom on Hover: Let shoppers inspect products up close just by hovering over the image.

- Transition Effects: Choose between fade, slide, or zoom transitions to control how the gallery switches images.

- Autoplay Gallery: Automatically rotate through gallery images every few seconds. Useful for drawing attention to multiple angles without needing clicks.

- Lightbox View: Allow customers to click and expand the gallery into a full-screen lightbox. You can enable or disable the lightbox icon trigger based on your design preference.

These features help increase engagement and make your product pages feel more premium.

&#9658; **Thumbnails and Navigation in Additional Variation Gallery**: Fast and user-friendly gallery browsing. For products with multiple gallery items, thumbnails offer a fast way to switch views. VARGAL gives you full control over how these thumbnails look and behave

- Thumbnail Hover Swap: Instantly switch the main image just by hovering over a thumbnail—no clicks needed.

- Thumbnail Slider: Display thumbnails in a scrollable slider, which is especially useful for smaller screens or when you have many images.

- Gap and Spacing Control: Adjust the spacing between thumbnails and between the thumbnails and the main image for a clean layout.

- Position Settings: Decide where thumbnails appear—top, bottom, left, or right—separately for desktop and mobile views.

Helps users find what they’re looking for quickly and encourages deeper browsing.

&#9658; **Style and Loading Customization for additional variation gallery**: Match the look and feel of your store. VARGAL – Additional Variation Gallery for WooCommerce includes styling options that let you personalize how the gallery looks and behaves as it loads

- Custom Loading Icons: Choose from a variety of pre-designed loading animations including Dual Ring, Facebook styles, Ripple, Spinner, and more.

- Color Picker: Set your icon color using an intuitive color wheel or hex value.

Little details like custom loaders can make your site feel more polished and professional.

&#9658; **Gallery Migration Tool**: Switch to VARGAL without losing your galleries. If you are already using another additional variation gallery plugin, VARGAL includes a built-in migration tool that lets you

-Import galleries from other plugins

-Replace your current VARGAL gallery content with the imported one
